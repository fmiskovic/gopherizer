# Internal Package Documentation

The internal package encapsulates the core functionality and business logic of the application.
This package is intended for internal use only and is inaccessible to external packages, enforcing a clear boundary for your application's domain logic.

## Overview

The internal package serves as the foundation for implementing domain-specific logic. It provides examples through the profile entity and supports a modular structure, allowing you to extend the package based on your application's needs.

## Structure and Customization

### Profile and Model Directories

- **Purpose:**</br> 
  - The `profile` package offer examples of organizing domain entities and their associated logic.
- **Flexibility:**</br> 
  - If you don't require these specific directories, you can safely remove them.
  - Replace or extend the directory structure to align with your application's domain logic.


### Adding Domain-Specific Directories

You can expand the internal package to include additional directories tailored to your application. For instance:
- **Health Checks:**:
  - A health directory can be useful for implementing monitoring and diagnostic services.
  - Example use cases:
    - Application heartbeat.
    - Dependency status checks (e.g., database, message queue).

### Best Practices

- **Keep Internal Logic Encapsulated:** </br>
  The internal package should only be used within the application to ensure a clear separation of concerns. Avoid exposing its contents to external consumers.

- **Modular Design:** </br>
  Structure the package to reflect your application's core domains and responsibilities, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

- **Consistency:** </br>
  Maintain a consistent organization of domain logic, making it easier for developers to navigate and extend.
